# Business Problem and Stakeholder
Stakeholder: A real estate company or a property rental platform looking to optimize their property listings for specific tenant preferences.
Business Problem: The company wants to predict the preferred type of tenant (e.g., Bachelors, Family) for a property based on its characteristics (e.g., rent, size, location, furnishing status). This prediction would help in tailoring property recommendations to potential renters, improving user experience and conversion rates.

Here's a sample README for your project:

Rental Property Price Prediction
Overview
This project involves predicting the rental price of properties using a dataset of rental listings. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, area type, city, and furnishing status. We use machine learning models to build a prediction system and evaluate its performance.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Posted On: Date when the property was listed.
BHK: Number of bedrooms.
Rent: Monthly rent in currency.
Size: Area of the property in square feet.
Floor: Floor number and total number of floors in the building.
Area Type: Type of area (e.g., Super Area, Carpet Area).
Area Locality: Locality of the property.
City: City where the property is located.
Furnishing Status: Furnishing status of the property (e.g., Unfurnished, Semi-Furnished).
Tenant Preferred: Type of tenants preferred (e.g., Bachelors/Family).
Bathroom: Number of bathrooms.
Point of Contact: Contact type (e.g., Contact Owner, Contact Agent).
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Identifying and imputing missing values.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features, such as polynomial features.
Categorical Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using OneHotEncoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing numerical features.
Model Building
We build and evaluate the following models:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model to establish a baseline.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy through multiple decision trees.
Other Models: Other models can be included as needed (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting).
Performance Metrics
We evaluate the models using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE, representing the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
R² Score: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Results
Linear Regression Model:

MAE: 25708.22
MSE: 4638921321.10
RMSE: 68109.63
R² Score: -0.16 (indicating poor fit)
Random Forest Regressor Model:

R² Score: 0.57 (indicating moderate fit)
Feature Importance
Feature importance is evaluated using:

Random Forest: Provides feature importance scores to identify the most influential features.
